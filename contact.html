			<p>This image was taken at Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada. These cabins were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, which was a public work relief program that was part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Back then, campers were allowed to stay in them, but they have since been prohibited.

			I have a lot more photography where this came from--both digital and black and white film photography that I developed myself. And of course, a story for each picture. If you'd like to see more, send me an email.
